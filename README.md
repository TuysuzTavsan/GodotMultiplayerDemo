Godot multiplayer demo via webrtc + signaling server.
Main purpose of this project is making a minimal multiplayer game with lobby system via webrtc and signaling server.
Using game engine Godot.
This project is not finished yet.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

projects:
1-Client
2-Server (signaling server for webrtc)
Code needs cleanup and all code hardcoded for 2 player game. I'll change it later to mesh if i feel like to.
Still didnt finish gameloop but the lobby system is OK for now.
